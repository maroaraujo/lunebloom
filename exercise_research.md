---

## First Trimester (Weeks 1-13)

### Key Changes
- Nausea and fatigue common
- Ligaments begin to relax (relaxin hormone)
- Avoid exercises lying flat on back after 12 weeks
- Focus on maintaining fitness, not building

### Safe Exercises
1. **Modified Squats** - Feet shoulder-width apart, controlled descent
2. **Wall Push-ups** - Reduce strain on joints
3. **Incline Treadmill Walking** - Easier on joints than flat
4. **Stationary Bike** - Low impact, comfortable
5. **Swimming** - Excellent full-body, low impact
6. **Modified Planks** - On knees or incline
7. **Bird Dogs** - Core and stability
8. **Glute Bridges** - Glute activation, back support
9. **Side-Lying Leg Lifts** - Hip and glute strength
10. **Arm Circles and Shoulder Presses** (light weight) - Upper body

### Modifications
- Reduce intensity by 20-30% from pre-pregnancy
- Avoid heavy lifting (>15-20 lbs)
- Stop exercises that cause dizziness or shortness of breath
- Increase water intake and rest periods

### Frequency
- 3-4 days per week strength (lighter weights)
- 4-5 days per week cardio (low to moderate intensity)

---

## Second Trimester (Weeks 14-27)

### Key Changes
- "Honeymoon period" - usually feel best
- Belly growing noticeably
- Center of gravity shifting
- Can continue most exercises with modifications
- Avoid deep twisting and lying flat on back

### Safe Exercises
1. **Goblet Squats** - Holding weight at chest helps balance
2. **Step-ups** - Leg strength, functional movement
3. **Incline Push-ups** - Hands on elevated surface
4. **Stationary Bike or Recumbent Bike** - Comfortable as belly grows
5. **Swimming and Water Aerobics** - Excellent for all trimesters
6. **Modified Planks** - Hands on elevated surface
7. **Side-Lying Leg Lifts** - Hip stability
8. **Glute Bridges** - Pelvic floor and glute strength
9. **Pelvic Tilts** - Core and back support
10. **Lateral Band Walks** - Hip and glute activation
11. **Chest Fly** (light weight) - Chest and shoulder strength
12. **Lat Pulldowns** - Back strength

### Exercises to Avoid/Modify
- No lying flat on back (use incline or side-lying)
- Avoid heavy weights
- Skip deep twisting movements
- Avoid high-impact activities
- No contact sports

### Frequency
- 3-4 days per week strength training
- 4-5 days per week cardio (moderate intensity)

---

## Third Trimester (Weeks 28-40)

### Key Changes
- Weight gain peaks
- Significant balance changes
- Pelvic pressure increases
- Prepare for labor and delivery
- Focus on pelvic floor and breathing

### Safe Exercises
1. **Wall Squats** - Support and stability
2. **Side-Lying Leg Lifts** - Hip and pelvic stability
3. **Pelvic Tilts** - Pelvic floor and core
4. **Glute Bridges** - Pelvic floor strength
5. **Modified Planks** (on knees or wall) - Core stability
6. **Kegel Exercises** - Pelvic floor strengthening
7. **Walking** - Best cardio, low impact
8. **Swimming** - Weightless feeling, full body
9. **Stationary Bike** - Low impact, comfortable
10. **Prenatal Yoga** - Flexibility and breathing
11. **Cat-Cow Stretches** - Spinal mobility
12. **Child's Pose** - Relaxation and stretching

### Breathing Focus
- Diaphragmatic breathing
- Practice for labor
- Pelvic floor breathing coordination

### Frequency
- 2-3 days per week light strength
- 4-5 days per week walking/swimming
- Daily stretching and breathing

### Intensity
- Very light weights or bodyweight only
- Focus on form and breathing
- Stop if any pain or discomfort
- Listen to body - fatigue is normal

## Postpartum Recovery (0-12 Weeks)

### Weeks 0-6 (Early Recovery)
**Focus: Gentle movement and breathing**

Safe Activities:
1. **Diaphragmatic Breathing** - Deep core work
2. **Pelvic Floor Breathing** - Gentle Kegels
3. **Pelvic Tilts** - Gentle core activation
4. **Glute Bridges** (light) - Glute activation
5. **Heel Slides** - Gentle leg movement
6. **Gentle Walking** - Start with 5-10 minutes
7. **Cat-Cow Stretches** - Spinal mobility
8. **Child's Pose** - Relaxation

**Frequency:** Daily gentle movement, 10-20 minutes

**Avoid:**
- Heavy lifting
- Running or jumping
- Intense core work
- Sit-ups or crunches
- High-impact activities

### Weeks 6-12 (Progressive Return)
**Focus: Gradual strength building**

Safe Exercises:
1. **Modified Squats** - Bodyweight or light weight
2. **Glute Bridges** - Progress to single-leg
3. **Side-Lying Leg Lifts** - Hip strength
4. **Incline Push-ups** - Upper body
5. **Plank Holds** (on knees) - Core stability
6. **Lunges** (light) - Leg strength
7. **Stationary Bike** - Cardio
8. **Brisk Walking** - 20-30 minutes
9. **Swimming** - Full body, low impact
10. **Resistance Band Exercises** - Light resistance

**Frequency:** 3-4 days per week strength, 4-5 days per week cardio

**Progression:**
- Increase duration before intensity
- Add resistance gradually
- Listen to body - some bleeding increase means slow down
- Pelvic floor health is priority

### Important Notes
- Get clearance from OB/GYN before starting exercise (usually 6 weeks)
- Breastfeeding may affect energy levels
- Sleep deprivation is real - adjust intensity accordingly
- Pelvic floor dysfunction is common - consider pelvic floor PT
- Diastasis recti (abdominal separation) requires modified core work

## General Safety Guidelines for All Phases

### Stop Exercise If:
- Vaginal bleeding or fluid leakage
- Chest pain or severe shortness of breath
- Severe headache or dizziness

### Hydration & Nutrition
- Drink 16-24 oz water per hour of exercise

- Increase calorie intake during pregnancy (300-500 extra/day)
- Maintain adequate protein intake

### Environmental Considerations
- Avoid exercising in extreme heat
- Stay well-hydrated
- Wear supportive, breathable clothing
- Invest in good sports bra (especially during pregnancy)
- Wear supportive shoes

### Pelvic Floor Health
